The first in Aberdeenshire was Alexander who was appointed Constable of The Bass in Inverurie in 1080 on behalf of the king his brother-in-law
The progenitor of the Clan is a man named Bartolf who was a nobleman from Hungary who came to Scotland in 1067
Bartolf was in the retinue of Edgar the theling brother of Saint Margaret of Scotland who was later the queen of Malcolm of Scotland
Bartholf later married Malcolm sister Princess Beatrix of Scotland
Bartolf was said to be a man of intellect and bravery and as a result Malcolm made him governor of the royal Edinburgh Castle and gave him estates in Fife Angus the Mearns and Aberdeenshire
t is said that Bartolf helped the queen across a dangerous river on a horse and that Bartolf told her to "grip fast" which is where the family motto originates
Bartolf established himself in the Garioch district of Aberdeenshire at a place then known as Lesselyn
At Lesselyn he built a castle and it is from there that the name evolved into Lesley and the various spelling variations
Bartolfs son was named Malcolm and was made constable of the royal Inverury Castle which he held for David II of Scotland
His great-grandson was Sir Norman Lesley who acquired the lands of Fythkill in Fife which were later called Lesley in about 1282
14th to 15th centuries: Rothes and Balquhain
The family sided with Robert the Bruce against firstly The Comyn in the Buchan and secondly Edward I and as a result were awarded further tracts of Aberdeenshire
They fought at the Battle of Bannockburn Sir Andrew de Lesly was one of the signatories of Declaration of Arbroath was sent to the Pope in 1320 asserting Scotlands independence
His grandson Walter died at the Battlew of Harlaw in 1411 together with six of his cousins from Balquhain
The chiefly line of the Clan passed to a junior branch of the family from whom the present Earl of Rothes descends
In 1391 Sir Norman Lesley believed that his only son David had been killed in the Crusades and therefore passed over his estates to his cousin Sir George Lesley
Then in 1398 after George Lesley had taken possession of the castle and lands David returned from the Crusades and claimed possession of his estate
The family managed to resolve the matter peacefully and in 1445 Sir George Lesleys grandson also called George was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Lesley of Leven and all of his lands were united into the barony of Ballinbreich
At some point before 1458 he was then advanced to the title of Earl of Rothes
